# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day -1: August 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about 100 Days of Code, and forked the repo. 

**Thoughts:** This has already got me pushing my comfort zone. I am uncomfortable posting on Twitter, but I will try and go ahead with it. 

**Link to work:** Maybe I'll start here tomorrow... https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn
