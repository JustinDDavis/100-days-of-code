# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day -1: August 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about 100 Days of Code, and forked the repo. 

**Thoughts:** This has already got me pushing my comfort zone. I am uncomfortable posting on Twitter, but I will try and go ahead with it. 

**Link to work:** Maybe I'll start here tomorrow... https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn


### Day 0: August 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a freeCodeCamp Algorithm Challenge (Find the Symmetric Difference).

**Thoughts:** I'm somewhat frustrated that I thought I could get through this challenge somewhat easily. But for some reason there a few elements to this that have caught me by surprise, and I've been unable to finish this challenge within an hour limit.

### Day 1: August 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Symmetric Difference challenege. 

**Thoughts:** I wasn't too far from the solution. I did find myself a little distracted with some messaging application. Tomorrow probably just need to work on keeping focused for the hour and the task at hand.
