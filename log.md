# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day -1: August 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about 100 Days of Code, and forked the repo. 

**Thoughts:** This has already got me pushing my comfort zone. I am uncomfortable posting on Twitter, but I will try and go ahead with it. 

**Link to work:** Maybe I'll start here tomorrow... https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn


### Day 0: August 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a freeCodeCamp Algorithm Challenge (Find the Symmetric Difference).

**Thoughts:** I'm somewhat frustrated that I thought I could get through this challenge somewhat easily. But for some reason there a few elements to this that have caught me by surprise, and I've been unable to finish this challenge within an hour limit.

### Day 1: August 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Symmetric Difference challenege. 

**Thoughts:** I wasn't too far from the solution. I did find myself a little distracted with some messaging application. Tomorrow probably just need to work on keeping focused for the hour and the task at hand.

### Day 2: August 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started to go back into Javascript Testing. Watching "Understanding TDD with Modern Javascript" and following along locally.

**Thoughts:** I wasn't too far from the solution. I did find myself a little distracted with some messaging application. Tomorrow probably just need to work on keeping focused for the hour and the task at hand.

### Day 3: August 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished TDD video and starting to work on another algorithm.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited and feel more confident going into this next challenge. I feel better prepared with testing, and am starting to get familiar with the tools.

### Day 4: August 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I'm considering the Inventory Update as complete. FCC says it doesn't pass, but my local tests do say it passes... 

**Thoughts:** I'm frustrated that my local tests pass, but FCC website doesn't. I'm considering this a win and moving on tomorrow.

### Day 5: August 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Switched over to start working on "Katas". Trying my hand at the ol' FizzBuzz. What kind of person said, "You know words that don't get used enough?...". 

**Thoughts:** I didn't get a lot of progress made it finishing this. But if hit a few issues trying to understanding jest's mocking library, just to see what testing against console log would look like.
