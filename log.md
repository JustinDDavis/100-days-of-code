# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day -1: August 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about 100 Days of Code, and forked the repo. 

**Thoughts:** This has already got me pushing my comfort zone. I am uncomfortable posting on Twitter, but I will try and go ahead with it. 

**Link to work:** Maybe I'll start here tomorrow... https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn


### Day 0: August 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a freeCodeCamp Algorithm Challenge (Find the Symmetric Difference).

**Thoughts:** I'm somewhat frustrated that I thought I could get through this challenge somewhat easily. But for some reason there a few elements to this that have caught me by surprise, and I've been unable to finish this challenge within an hour limit.

### Day 1: August 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Symmetric Difference challenege. 

**Thoughts:** I wasn't too far from the solution. I did find myself a little distracted with some messaging application. Tomorrow probably just need to work on keeping focused for the hour and the task at hand.

### Day 2: August 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started to go back into Javascript Testing. Watching "Understanding TDD with Modern Javascript" and following along locally.

**Thoughts:** I wasn't too far from the solution. I did find myself a little distracted with some messaging application. Tomorrow probably just need to work on keeping focused for the hour and the task at hand.

### Day 3: August 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished TDD video and starting to work on another algorithm.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited and feel more confident going into this next challenge. I feel better prepared with testing, and am starting to get familiar with the tools.

### Day 4: August 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I'm considering the Inventory Update as complete. FCC says it doesn't pass, but my local tests do say it passes... 

**Thoughts:** I'm frustrated that my local tests pass, but FCC website doesn't. I'm considering this a win and moving on tomorrow.

### Day 5: August 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Switched over to start working on "Katas". Trying my hand at the ol' FizzBuzz. What kind of person said, "You know words that don't get used enough?...". 

**Thoughts:** I didn't get a lot of progress made it finishing this. But if hit a few issues trying to understanding jest's mocking library, just to see what testing against console log would look like.

### Day 6: August 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Wrapped up my initial try on FizzBuzz. With the extra time today, I used Tom Scott's video to reflect on how I approached the problem myself.

**Thoughts:**  Today went well. I felt like I was productive, and was self-reflective on my faults and where I could get better.

### Day 7: August 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Diving deeper into Unit Tests using the first few chapters of the 3rd edition "The Art of Unit Testing" by Roy Osherove. 

**Thoughts:**  This resource is really starting to make me think through how to write tests in a valuable way. I'm learning a lot and I'm not even out of the first chapter. I should have started here a long time ago!

### Day 8: August 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished Chapter 1 of "The Art of Unit Testing".

**Thoughts:**  Still learning a lot... excited to learn more.

### Day 9: August 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: And... only the first chapter was available for free. I will consider it after its fully published, for now, i'll move to something else. 

**Thoughts:**  Moved onto the "String Calculator" kata. So far... its putting me through the paces.

### Day 10: August 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made it through Step 4 of the "String Calculator" kata.

**Thoughts:**  Well... using more Regex that I thought I would be using. Making progress.

### Day 11: August 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from the Kata and worked in Terraform to try and build a template for static website.
